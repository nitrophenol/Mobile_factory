# Mobile Factory Project

The Mobile Factory project is a Django-based web application that simplifies the process of creating orders for mobile devices. It provides a RESTful API built using Django REST Framework (DRF) for handling order creation and management.

## Project Structure

The project directory structure is organized as follows:

- **mobile_factory/**: Main Django project directory.
  - **enums.py**: Defines enums for input types, component types, and components.
  - **errors.py**: Contains custom error classes for the project.
  - **constants.py**: Defines dictionaries mapping input types to prices, component types to component names, and input types to component types.
  - **data_classes.py**: Contains data classes for API responses and controllers.
  - **controllers/**: Folder containing controller logic for handling order creation and management.
  - **tests/**: Folder containing unit tests for the project.
  - **serializers.py**: Contains serializers for creating orders.
  - Other standard Django project files and folders.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Setup Virtual Environment**:

    - Create a virtual environment:
